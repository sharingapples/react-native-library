React Native components and modules library

1. <b>Scheduled Notification</b><br>
Scheduled Notification is a library for use within react-native for generating time based
notification that uses AlarmManager in Android and LocalNotification in iOS.

It combines the way the different libraries in the different platform work and allows you 
to use a single library that works in both.
